# Create dict

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

### Task

You already know, that not all data types can be used as a keys
in dictionary in Python. But someone, who pass arguments to function
`create_dict` does not. You need to help him:

Write `create_dict` function, which will receive as many arguments as needed
and create a dictionary, in which keys are these arguments (each argument is different key) provided to the function
and values are the positions of these arguments.

Of course, not all arguments provided will be accepted for dict creation.
Print `f"Cannot add {argument} to the dict!"` for each argument, that is not accepted.

It is agreed, that arguments provided to `create_dict` function will be
only of next types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `NoneType`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, `function`.

Also in this task, you should not use `hash` function or `try/except` constructions.
Hint: use `isinstance`.


### Required Task
Create function `create_dict` if:

For all arguments provided to `create_dict` we will have maximum nesting level = 2:

- `create_dict([1, 2, [1, 2]])` - nesting level = 2, because first parameter has list in list - ok.
- `create_dict([1, 2, 3])` - nesting level = 1 - ok, because list is already has level 1.
- `create_dict(1)` - nesting level = 0 - ok.
- `create_dict([1, [2, [3, 4]]])` - nesting level = 3 - not ok, won't be passed such list in function.

Examples:
```python
print(create_dict(7, 1, 3))
# {7: 0, 1: 1, 3: 2}
print(create_dict(3, [1, 2], 5))
# Cannot add [1, 2] to the dict!
# {3: 0, 5: 2}
print(create_dict(3, (1, 2), 5))
# {3: 0, (1, 2): 1, 5: 2}
print(create_dict(3, (1, [2, 3]), 5))
# Cannot add (1, [2, 3]) to the dict!
# {3: 0, 5: 2}
```


### Optional Task
Create function `create_dict` if:

Each collection type provided to the `create_dict` function is not limited to any nesting level.

If you want to solve this Task - go to `tests/test_main.py` file and uncomment the full last test :)

Examples:
```python
print(create_dict(7, 1, 3))
# {7: 0, 1: 1, 3: 2}
print(create_dict(3, [1, 2], 5))
# Cannot add [1, 2] to the dict!
# {3: 0, 5: 2}
print(create_dict(3, (1, 2), 5))
# {3: 0, (1, 2): 1, 5: 2}
print(create_dict(3, (1, (10, (7, [2, 3]))), 5))
# Cannot add (1, (10, (7, [2, 3]))) to the dict!
# {3: 0, 5: 2}
```
